          The term <em>secure computation</em> is here rather loosely defined as whatever I find
          relevant. This includes a number of topics in cryptography such as Multi-Party
          Computation, Fully Homomorphic Encryption, Oblivious RAM and so on.

          I keep the list as a way for me to stay somewhat up to date with new developments in this
          area, and to have an easy way to find papers. The list is generated manually by going over
          the eprint RSS feed a few times a month. If you feel like I missed a paper let me know, and
          I will consider adding it to the list.

          The site uses the <a href="https://github.com/dhg/Skeleton">Skeleton</a> CSS boiler plate
          framework. It is hosted on GitHub and the source can be found
